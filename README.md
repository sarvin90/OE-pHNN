# Port-Hamiltonian Neural Networks with Output Error Noise Models

This repository contains the code for the paper **"Port-Hamiltonian Neural Networks with Output Error Noise Models"**. The implementation is based on the [DeepSI toolbox](https://deepsi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which provides tools for system identification using deep learning methods.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to install the DeepSI toolbox. Please follow the installation guide provided in the official documentation: [DeepSI Installation Guide](https://deepsi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Repository Structure

- `2MSD.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for simulating a two-connected spring-mass-damper (2MSD) system.
- `Cascaded_tanks.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook presents the results of the model applied to the Cascaded Tanks benchmark introduced in [Nonlinear Benchmark](https://www.nonlinearbenchmark.org/benchmarks/cascaded-tanks).
- `Trained_models`: This folder contains trained model files for different configurations, including:
  - Various training sizes
  - Different truncation lengths
  - Different noise levels
  - Different integrator methods
